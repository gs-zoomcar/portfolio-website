    content: `We went to great schools. All our teachers, parents, friends, they all taught us a lot. They taught us how days become nights; they taught us how to eat; they taught us to love, to sacrifice at times, to achieve happiness, everything we know. It is a lot. This complete tree of knowledge around our world, it’ll require years to be completely able to comprehend it; to appreciate it.

But does this span everything? I believe most of us still have an unexplored branch.

Let’s try to complete the tree.
The world is made of people, check.
People are made of cells, check.
What puts this intricate system of connected cells to life? Let’s assume that it’s the soul.
This assumption raises the ambiguity to an alarmingly high degree. Well now, what is a soul possibly made of? 

Yes, <b>Words</b>.

Words are the building blocks of our soul; of our conscience. Their orientation, delivery, comprehension, moulds our soul in the most inexplicable fashion. They shape our thinking. They form the backbone of beliefs, which eventually, is what we reflect as a person. Words have the power to build, to keep us going, to devastate. A small variation in the set of words we use can bring a huge impact on lives.

There are no superheros with capes in our world. They don’t fly or shoot with lasers coming out of their eyes, but they still manage to change the world. It’s a simple protocol. Their words open new paths of possibilities. Consider Wave-Particle Duality. We always saw things as matter and light as wave, but the clash with reality shattered these rules. That’s how our lives work.

So what has to be done?

Talk. Let it out. Talk to people. Tell them if they’re right. Tell them they’re wrong. Tell them that you appreciate. Tell them if you see there’s scope for improvement. Your words bring change to at least one life, and that’s yours. 

We live on a small planet positioned somewhere in this vast universe. There’s no one outside who’s gonna care for us. It’s time for me to start caring for you, you to start caring for others and us to start caring for ourselves.`,

    content: `You’ve fought well, my friend. You bled, you healed; did the poison still remain inside?
Things seem calm, but then, isn’t there this voice calling you back? To fight, maybe? what is it about that fight? Do you still wage it? Who is the enemy? Do you see anything through this haze of chaos?

Why these blisters on your soul still remain?
Why do you seek redemption?
What do you want to redeem?

The fight has not ended; It’s the war that is to commence.

Not all dreams are pleasing.
“I see the reflection from waves, as I struggle against the channels that pull me inside”
That last scream, as you see yourself fading into nothingness.

“Wake up, what are you doing?”
“No! This is where it all started. I need to save myself.”

As you head back to the water, the scream gets fainter.
The other side of the coin is no different. You can barely see your scars, as the water blocks the sight of your better half; standing outside, worried, helpless; the soul however, is perfectly visible, even with closed eyes.

“What do I see?”

“I see wounds”
“I see tears”
“I see emptiness as I strive to contentment”

Turn around, leave the helpless you. Let it see how you become a part of this void, as you dive inside the water.

“Where am I headed?”

You must find the way and you will.

And thus, began the war of <b>dream and reality.</b>`,

    content: `The ending college life brings a lot of memories and emotions. It was a great journey. Subtle ups, great downs, but there’s more than that; did you enjoy?

I can safely (and proudly) say I enjoyed, <b>A LOT.</b>  

It made me a person I never imagined I could be. It all happened because of people around me. 3 years, away from home, trying to find meaning to existence. But then, you look around and see many, many doing the same thing; infinitely many paths, converging to a single state, Happiness.  It’s almost a beautiful mess that cannot be carved in words.

Well, this post isn’t about how college has been, how I changed, how scenario changed, this one’s for the people.

There are many people who believe that someone can be absolutely good or bad, I think it’s all relative. We compare before we make decisions and it all comes downs to one’s judgement. No one’s bad at the core, they all reflect what they have seen in life. In the same fashion, no one’s absolute good either; it’s all your judgement that makes them good or bad.

What I think of people? They’re great. Maybe I talk to them a lot, maybe I see the good in them, maybe I am the worst of all and I find everyone good because of that, we’ll never know anything for certain. It’s a weird science that governs everything. People never stop to amaze; they amaze in the most unexpected ways. Some of them won’t ever utter a word, they amaze through their actions. You, right now, are amazing someone too. It’s also true that not all amazement are pleasing. Some of them make you angry, sad, hopeless, etc., but trust me, we are not strong enough to carry these feelings throughout our lifetime. The least you can do is to sort it out and move on. It’s my strong belief that giving up on people is one of the most moronic and sad things you’ll do in life. As I mentioned previously, our paths converge, they are all directed towards getting happiness. Everyone is trying to achieve happiness, which evidently changes from time to time and person to person. There’s a fair chance that sometime your paths may interleave, they may cross with each other’s, they might even result in complete destruction, but I don’t believe that it can be intentional, or in other words, you see it much before if it’s intentional. The point stands rigid, no one is bad at the core. How can someone possibly sleep at night knowing that they intentionally harmed someone? You can’t, right? Nor can I.

It’s just the right amount of effort that sets things right. Don’t pull it too much, don’t push it too much. Just safely slide it till the point where everyone is happy. There’s always that one point in every situation, you gotta find it.

Don’t put a big no to all the amazement and amusement coming to your life. Never give up on anyone.`,
